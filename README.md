# Logit_SVM_NLP
Logit model practice with finding the gradient of the Elastic Net loss and its formulas. Implementing self made gradient descent. 

Different kernels and hyperparameters for SVM. Optimization be GridSearch. 

Natural Language Processing. Preprocess (tokenization and clean, vectorize words using both bag of words and tf-idf) the dataset.
